# GalleryImagesUploadSwift

## Spark Networks Coding Challenge

**Objective:**

Please provide a gallery with an image upload feature. This exercise is mostly front end with a tiny bit of back end. If you're stronger on the backend, you can try this one, but we'll definitely be looking strength on the front end. Please also ensure both the client and server side is well tested and clean code and that the code works before you submit your code.

**App Requirements:**

For the image upload please provide:

a gallery view of all previously uploaded images
a button which can either request to take a picture, or upload from camera roll
the ability to rotate or crop images

**Installation:**

Once downloaded please open terminal and run following command $cd: pathToGalleryImagesUploadSwift $ pod install
